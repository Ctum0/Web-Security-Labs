This repository contains my hands-on learning notes and writeups in web application security.

Focus areas include:

HTTP & web fundamentals

Burp Suite manual testing workflow

OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

SQL Injection and other common web flaws

All work is performed in legal lab environments and documented with clear explanations, impact, and fixes.

This repo will evolve as my skills progress.
